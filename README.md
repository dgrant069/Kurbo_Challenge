Events and Weather API Masher
==============================


### How to use?
Run the following script in your CLI:
$ "ruby get_events_weather.rb"


### What is it doing?
This script uses Ruby's built in Net::http class to connect and interact with 2
APIs - Wunderground's weather API and Meetup's event API.
I saved the specific JSON received from API that I wanted (dates, weather info, event places, etc) into a hash.
I then added "value" (the weather info) from the weather hash to the Meetup hash, based on the key (the dates).

### What were the steps?
1. Identify the API's to use - 1h
2. Get an API key for each - 15m
3. Read documentation for how to call, what info/methods are available, and what the response looks like - 3-4h
4. Play with JSON to get the data I wanted from each - 1h
5. Design/write methods to pull out and reassemble the data in the way I want - 3-4h
6. Combine them and display to CLI - 1h
7. Added in some error handling for bad user input - 30m
8. Readme - 30m
